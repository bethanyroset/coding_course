<p>I am currently learning to code With <a href="http://codefirstgirls.com">Code First Girls</a> Going over everything from how the internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks! Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...</p>

<p>1. HTML is cool</p>
<p>2.CSS is cooler</p>
<p>3.JS is the best</p>



<h2> What do you need to create a Website?</h2>

Not much!
A computer (always a good start)
A text editor (I am using atom)
A web browser (I am using chrome)
Some HTML, CSS and JS files
